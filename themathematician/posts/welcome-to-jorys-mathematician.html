            My name is Jorys A. Mahamba, and this space — "Jorys, The Mathematician" — represents something I've been 
            dreaming about for years: a place where mathematical rigor meets human curiosity, where abstract theorems 
            dance with lived experience, and where the pursuit of truth becomes an act of liberation.
          </p>

          <p>
            At 20 years old, I'm French, from a Portuguese born mother and a Congolese father, a student preparing for my MSc in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics 
            at the University of Oxford, in England, and someone who believes deeply that mathematics is not just about solving equations — 
            it's about understanding the very fabric of reality and our place within it.
          </p>

          <div class="vision-box">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-blue-700">My Vision for This Space</h3>
            <p class="text-lg">
              "Mathematics is the language in which God has written the universe, but it's also a language 
              in which we can write our freedom."
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-orange-700">Why "Jorys, The Mathematician"?</h2>

          <p>
            Actually, it's nothing more than a reference to one of my favorite musical artists, Tyler, The Creator. 
            I hesitated for long between "The Mathematician", "The Curious Mind", "The Explorer", or other such denominations, 
            but I finally chose the most simple, which is I believe, also all-encompassing in some sense.
          </p>

          <p>
            This blog is where I bring together all the pieces of who I am: the rigorous thinker who loves the 
            elegance of geometry, and find great comfort in the abstraction of category theory, the dreamer who sees mathematics as a form of 
            emancipation, the 20-year-old who finished high school at 15 and sometimes still feels like he's 
            catching up to his own ambitions...
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            "Mathematics is not just what I do — it's how I see the world. Every pattern in nature, every 
            symmetry in art, every structure in society can be understood through the lens of mathematical thinking."
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This isn't your typical academic blog, nor is it purely personal. It's something in between — 
            a space where I can explore ideas without the constraints of formal publication, where I can 
            make connections between seemingly disparate fields, and where I can share the wonder I feel 
            when mathematics reveals its secrets.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-orange-600">🔢 Mathematics & Physics</h3>
          <p>
            From accessible explanations of complex concepts to deep dives into cutting-edge research, 
            I'll share the mathematical ideas that fascinate me. You'll find posts about:
          </p>

          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-orange-700">A Different Kind of Mathematics Blog</h2>

          <p>
            What makes this space different? It's the recognition that mathematics is fundamentally human. 
            Every theorem was discovered by a person with hopes, fears, and cultural context. Every equation 
            represents someone's attempt to understand something about our universe.
          </p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p class="font-semibold mb-2">🎯 My Promise to You</p>
            <p>
              I promise to never talk down to you, to always credit the human stories behind mathematical ideas, 
              and to show that mathematics is not just for a select few — it's for anyone curious enough to ask 
              "why?" and patient enough to seek answers.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Whether you're a fellow mathematician, a curious student, someone who "hates math" but loves 
            beautiful ideas, or just someone who believes in the power of knowledge to transform lives — 
            this space is for you.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-orange-700">My Journey So Far</h2>

          <p>
            Let me share a bit about the path that brought me here. I finished high school at 15 — not because 
            I was trying to rush through life, but because I was hungry for knowledge and the French system 
            allowed me to accelerate. After three years in the most intensive French scientific program, the <em>Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Ecoles</em>, 
            I completed dual BSc degrees in Mathematics and Physics as valedictorian 
            at UPEC, all while maintaining my training as a competitive karateka and handball player: 
            I hold a 1st Dan Shotokan karate black belt and won multiple competitions, up to international level, in both handball and karate 
            (I also played badminton up to international level before finishing high-school).
          </p>

          <p>
            After an exploratory break into the world of AI and data sciences, as I prepare to begin my MSc at Oxford in October 2025, I'm at an exciting crossroads. 
            I'm old enough to have developed my own perspectives on mathematics and physics, but young enough 
            to still feel the wonder of discovery. I'm experienced enough to engage with cutting-edge research, 
            but still remember what it feels like to struggle with new concepts.
          </p>

          <p>
            This combination — of rigorous training and maintained curiosity, of academic achievement and 
            human empathy — is what I bring to this blog.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-orange-700">Freedom as My North Star</h2>

          <p>
            You'll notice the word "freedom" appears often in my writing. It's not just rhetoric — it's the 
            philosophical foundation of everything I do. I see the pursuit of knowledge as fundamentally an 
            act of liberation: liberation from ignorance, from limited perspectives, from fear, from the constraints 
            that others might try to place on our thinking, or even from death...
          </p>

          <p>
            When I understand a new theorem, when I make a connection 
            between previously separate ideas — I become a little more free. And when I share that knowledge, 
            when I help others see these connections, I'm participating in the collective liberation of human 
            understanding.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-orange-700">What's Coming Next</h2>

          <p>
            In the coming months, you can expect:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Deep dives into current research:</strong> I'll explain my fascination with quantum gravity, string theory, and category theory in accessible terms</li>
            <li><strong>Educational content:</strong> Making complex mathematical ideas accessible to anyone willing to think deeply</li>
            <li><strong>Personal insights:</strong> The joys and challenges of life as a young mathematician</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I'll also be sharing my journey as I prepare for Oxford, reflecting on what it means to study 
            mathematical and theoretical physics at one of the world's leading universities, and exploring 
            how this experience shapes my understanding of mathematics and my place in the scientific community.
          </p>

            This isn't just my blog — it's a conversation. I want to hear from you: your questions, your 
            insights, your own connections between mathematics and life. Whether you're a seasoned researcher 
            or someone who's never thought about mathematics as beautiful, your perspective matters.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can connect with me through the comments on posts, via email, or on social media. I'm particularly
