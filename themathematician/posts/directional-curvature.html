            <p>
              Sometimes the most interesting mathematical discoveries come not from finding what you're looking for, 
              but from realizing you've found something else entirely. This is the story of how sleep deprivation 
              and mathematical obsession led me to a curious cousin of geodesic curvature.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            I thought I had rediscovered geodesic curvature, but I instead discovered a notion of "directional" 
            curvature running on 5 hours of sleep and pure mathematical adrenaline. Let me tell you about this story!
          </p>

          <p>
            Wednesday at 4 am, I called it a night when I couldn't figure out what the Gauss map was. Today, 
            a bit before 9 am, I had a breakthrough when building towards Gauss-Bonnet. After having slept for 
            the rest of the night on Wednesday, I got back at it and I got the Gauss map intuitively with fresh eyes. 
            So today I decided to jump right into section 4.5 of Do Carmo's Differential Geometry textbook which 
            tackles the Gauss-Bonnet theorem â€” the guiding light of my internship.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-orange-700">The First Glimpse: Gauss's Original Theorem</h2>

          <p>
            It began by presenting the first version of the theorem, due to Gauss, stating the formula to understand 
            the correction in the sum of the internal angles of a triangle on a curved surface from the usual $\pi$ 
            brought by the curvature of the surface. The corrective term is simply the integral of the curvature 
            over the triangle, which explains why the sum of the angles of a triangle on the surface on earth is 
            greater than $\pi$, while lower than $\pi$ on the surface of an apple core. When the surface is flat, 
            of course, we fall back on the known $\pi$ sum.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-orange-700">The Generalization: Theorem of Turning Tangents</h2>

          <p>
            But this insight can be generalized to more complicated closed shapes, from loop-like to complicated surfaces. 
            Let's begin with the loop-like shapes. A simple closed, piecewise, regular, parametrized curve is basically 
            a continuous loop, possibly with a finite number of vertices but not self-intersecting. The theorem of 
            Turning Tangents is the analogue of the previous Gauss' theorem for these kinds of shapes on a surface. 
            It states that the sum of how much the curve intrinsically bends on the surface with how much we suddenly 
            change directions at vertices is $2\pi$ (the sign might change depending on the orientation but this will 
            be the story of another post).
          </p>

          <div class="physics-analogy">
            <h4 class="font-semibold mb-3">ðŸŽ¯ Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Curvature</h4>
            <p>
              What I mean by the "intrinsic curvature" of the loop is that if we look at the situation from an 
              external point of view, being in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the curvature of the loop will be due to both its 
              own curvature and the curvature of the surface it relies on! But if we stay grounded on the surface, 
              only the curvature of the loop itself matters, the same way you don't feel the curvature of the earth 
              when you cycle down a street, but you feel the curvature of your path when you are taking a turn.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            In technical terms, you don't feel the curvature when you are following a geodesic; I discovered later 
            that what I had been calling "intrinsic curvature" was the notion of geodesic curvature!
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-orange-700">The Robot Analogy: Understanding Turning Angles</h2>

          <p>
            But the story goes onâ€¦ For a loop with no vertices, we would be done. Adding the effects of the geodesic 
            curvature along the path would have made us circle back to our point of origin, then having made a 
            rotation of $2\pi$. For more complicated shapes, with edges, we can see that these effects are not enough. 
            It is because at some points, the vertices, we took sudden turns which don't account for the geodesic curvature.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            You can see this as how a walking robot might turn: he would go in a straight line, rotate, and proceed 
            to go in a straight line again. If he was to walk 10 m in an allÃ©e, turn around, walk back to his 
            original point and turn back again, he would have completed the cycle, being in the exact same state 
            (position and orientation) without having followed any curved path; here, the changes of directions 
            would have taken all the credit.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            For hybrid shapes like with curved parts and edges, the contributions of curvatures and turns add up 
            to complete the cycle.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-orange-700">The Discovery: "Directional" Curvature</h2>

          <p>
            When I then tried to test my understanding to the case of geodesic triangles, I realized that it was 
            not the geodesic curvature that I had discovered, but some cousin notion of "directional" curvature. 
            As the turning angles are $(\pi - \text{internal angle})$, we get that their sum is $3\pi - \sum(\text{internal angles})$. 
            Using Gauss' theorem, this is equal to $2\pi - \iint K \, dA$. The $2\pi$ cancel out and we get that 
            the integral (sum) of the curvature on the triangle is the sum of the directional curvature of the edges 
            (and not intrinsic curvature, which would be 0 for geodesics), which makes it all make sense!

          <div class="insight-box">
            <h4 class="font-semibold mb-3">âœ¨ The Key Insight</h4>
            <p>
              What I had discovered wasn't geodesic curvature at all â€” it was a "directional" notion of curvature 
              that relates the Gaussian curvature of a region to the turning behavior along its boundary. This 
              relationship becomes crystal clear when you work through the mathematics of geodesic triangles!

          <p>
            This insight then extends towards the local Gauss-Bonnet theorem which states the same thing as the 
            theorem of Turning Tangents for surfaces homeomorphic to a disk and taking into account their curvature, 
            while the global Gauss-Bonnet theorem takes on more general surfaces and surprisingly connect them to 
            their topology through a topological invariant name the Euler-PoincarÃ© characteristicâ€¦ this will have 
            to wait a bit to be explored here!

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-orange-700">Reflections on Mathematical Discovery</h2>

          <p>
            Looking back on this sleep-deprived journey, I'm struck by how mathematical understanding often comes 
            in unexpected ways. I set out to understand the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and ended up discovering a 
            personal way of thinking about the relationship between different types of curvature.
          </p>

          <p>
            The "directional" curvature I discovered might not be a new mathematical concept â€” it's likely just 
            a particular way of interpreting known relationships. But the process of discovery, of building intuition 
            through confusion and breakthrough, is what makes mathematics so thrilling. Sometimes you need to get 
            lost to find a path that truly makes sense to you.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            "In mathematics, the journey of understanding is often more valuable than the destination. Every 
            mathematician builds their own mental map of the territory, and sometimes the most crooked paths 
            lead to the clearest views."
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            As I continue my internship exploring the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, I carry with me this lesson: 
            mathematical understanding isn't just about learning what's in the textbooks â€” it's about building 
            your own bridges between concepts, even if those bridges take unexpected forms in the early morning 
            hours fueled by pure mathematical adrenaline.

              I find that the most meaningful insights often come from wrestling with concepts until 
              they reveal their hidden connections.
